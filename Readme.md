# Snippets

Various Functions and little scripts I accumulated over time

---

## Scripts

### discord-experimental-tab.js

Enables the Discord Experimental tab.

#### How to use

1. Open the Discord Dev tools (str+shift+i). This only works in non-stable builds or if you put ```json "DANGEROUS_ENABLE_DEVTOOLS_ONLY_ENABLE_IF_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_YOURE_DOING": true``` in your settings.json
2. Navigate to the Console Tab
3. Paste the ```content of discord-experimental-tab.js``` into the Console and press Enter

This is not persistent, if you reload (str+r) or reopen Discord it will be deactivated again
